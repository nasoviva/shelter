<p align="center">This project is about creating a website with two pages, making it
responsive and interactive. The main focus is on ensuring the layout
adapts smoothly across different devices, while also maintaining
interactivity. It involved writing clean and maintainable code, exporting
styles and graphics from Figma, and using JavaScript to implement all
the necessary features.</p>
